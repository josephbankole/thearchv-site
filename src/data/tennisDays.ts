// that week. status 'verified' = filed and checked against two independent sources.
// The daily engine (../scripts/archv-site-commit.mjs, key `tennis`) prepends new entries after
// the anchor line below; keep that line byte-stable. Shares the DayEntry shape with football
// so the build scripts and feed treat every sport identically. Starts empty by design: the
// desk opens this week.
